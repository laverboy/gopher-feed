# Feed the Gopher
The Gophers are going to die! Unless you can stop it. Feed the gophers faster than they are starving and they may just survive.

## What?
Don't worry this is just a dumb kata for learning about golang channels. No gophers were harmed during the making of it.

At some point this will be a useful starting repo for a kata.

## Kata Steps

1. Make it so that life can't go above 100, it's bad to over-feed a gopher
2. Don't allow gophers to resurrect, no-one wants zombie gophers.
3. Uncomment the reset button in index.html. Make it so that when the `{"Reset": true}` message is received by the program the state goes back to the beginning
4. RACE CONDITION alert, can't update in two places whilst also reading from another, need channels
